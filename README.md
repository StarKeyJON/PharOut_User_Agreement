                The Marketplace contracts are yet to be professionally audited. <br /> The Temp-Mint and "PharOut/Pham"
                NFT contracts are the only contracts enabled for interaction on mainnet at this point.
                <br/> The full marketplace proxy suite has been deployed and coded in for website testing/interaction.
                <br/> Please only test if you are sure of what you are doing. Functions and settings are subject to change as we build.
